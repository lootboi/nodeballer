[DISCLAIMER] Present BIN info is the only working function currently

nodeballer is a simple terminal based program to help you quickly value items when lowballing in Skyblock. It currently only uses @kr45732/rust-query-api to pull information but is quick and lightweight. No more waiting 30 seconds for auction info platforms to parse data for you!
